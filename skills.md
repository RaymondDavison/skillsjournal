## About
I am a DevOps Engineer with extensive experience in managing; IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and On-Prem Infrastructures with 5 years of IT experience. I have worked for 3 years as a Data Analyst and cumulatively 4 years as a DevOps Engineer. During this period, I have set up and maintained CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes Clusters on Cloud Infrastructures. I have also gained extensive knowledge in Data Science and Machine Learning.
